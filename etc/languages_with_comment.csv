Sunday Island and a few other islands in the Buccaneer archipelago are correct (Bowern 2012) but Augustus Island, a bit too far to the east, is not correct. It is now uninhabited but was inhabited by Worora [wro] until 1950. The W&H L023 map indeed does not show Djawi on Augustus island, so difficult to see how the association appeared. Thus the Polygon should either be attached to Worora [wra] or removed."
