    "description": "Wurm & Hattori’s Language Atlas of the Pacific Area describes the geographic speaker areas of the languages and language varieties spoken in the Pacific. Thanks to the efforts of the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative, this monumental piece of work has been available in digital form for over 15 years. But lacking proper identification of language varieties this digitized data was largely unusable for today’s research methods. This CLDF dataset turns ECAI’s digitized artefacts of the Language Atlas into an open, reusable geo-referenced dataset of speaker area polygons for a quarter of the world’s languages.",
